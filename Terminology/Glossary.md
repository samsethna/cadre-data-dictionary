## Sensitive data

Sensitive data is data which includes personally identifiable information such as names, addresses and identifying numbers. It is also data which has been de-identified (has had all personal identifiable information removed) but is still sensitive due to the potential for re-identification.


## Data research

Sensitive data is often used for research to better understand how society works. For example, researchers analyse sensitive data to develop new insights into issues such as education, health, the environment, the economy and more. These insights can help to inform public policy and services.


## Data analysis

Data analysis is what happens during data research. Data is analysed – or inspected – to generate insights about an issue. For example, education data might be analysed to investigate how well schools are performing, to inform improvement.


## Data research infrastructure

Data research infrastructure refers to the systems and processes in place to support data research. It includes physical systems, such as the data centres where the data itself is held; the computer software that researchers use to analyse data; the governance that exists around it; and the people who run the systems and do the research. It is everything that makes data research happen.


## Trusted research environment (TRE)

A trusted research environment (TRE) is a digital system that securely holds and provides access to sensitive data for approved researchers. Strict security measures protect the privacy of the people the data is about and significantly reduce the potential for data misuse or the possibility of re-identification of data which has been de-identified (had all personal identifying information like names and addresses removed).


## Secure remote connection

It is possible for researchers to connect to a trusted research environment (TRE) via a secure remote connection. This allows researchers to securely access data held within a TRE from a convenient location, instead of being physically present within the TRE building. When accessed via a secure remote connection, data can be viewed on the researcher’s screen but not downloaded to their computer – the data itself remains in the TRE, and the researcher accesses the system via a virtual desktop. Strong security controls protect the data, and access is monitored by TRE staff.


## Data linkage

When data from different places or sectors – such as healthcare and education – is linked together, this can provide valuable insights into how different areas of life affect one another. For example, if researchers link the healthcare records of a large group of people to their school exam results, and look at patterns in the data, they can see what types of health condition might have a negative affect on school attainment, and what impact experiences at school might have on health. This insight can help inform services to support those who need it most.


## Data custodian

The person or organisation who is responsible for looking after data and keeping it safe and secure.


## Federated

A ‘federated’ network of trusted research environments (TREs) is one which would allow analysis of sensitive data to be conducted across different secure environments. This is because the TREs would all follow the same security and governance protocols, and the different systems used across them would be able to work together coherently.

This can occur in two different ways. In the first approach, the analysis of multiple sets of data occurs in the TREs in which they are held, and the results are brought together centrally in one secure environment for final review. This approach works well for analysis on comparable data held in different TREs. The second approach is to temporarily combine the data. This would allow approved researchers to access and analyse data within any TRE in the network, rather than only within the one where the data is held, making access to data more efficient, whilst remaining secure. This approach is appropriate for linking data held in separate TREs together.


## Interoperability

Interoperability means different TREs – often managed by different organisations – can work together so that users can work across them. This is achieved by enabling the different systems or components of the TREs to successfully ‘communicate’ with one another, allowing them to connect and exchange information between one another.
