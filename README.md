# CADRE-Data-Dictionary
This repository contains the CADRE data dictionaries for the CCC and CPFT datasets.
Both dictionaries present fields in the following order: OMOP Table, Source Table, Source Field, Source Response, OMOP Mapping, and OMOP Concept ID.
Copies of both CSV files are available for download, allowing users to rearrange column order as needed.
